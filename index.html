    <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
    <p>
      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; At MIT, we revel in a culture of learning by
      doing. In 30 departments across five schools and one college, our students
      combine analytical rigor with curiosity, playful imagination, and an
      appetite for solving the hardest problems in service to society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Institute’s fall 2014 student body of 11,319 is highly diverse.
      Students come from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, three
      territories and dependencies, and 116 foreign countries. The Institute’s
      3,302 international students make up ten percent of the undergraduate
      population and 42 percent of the graduate population. See pages 106-108
      for more information about international students.

    <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
    <p>
      At MIT, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and possibility is our joyful
      obsession, and we celebrate fundamental discoveries and practical
      applications alike. As educators, we also value research as a potent form
      of learning by doing. Through MIT’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities
      Program (UROP(opens in new window)), more than 85% of undergraduates
      enrich their education through engaging in frontline, faculty-led
      research.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>ALUMINI</h2>
    <p>
      MIT’s alumni — entrepreneurs, researchers, policymakers, and above all,
      leaders — have helped to shape the world we know today. From 3-D printing
      to bionic prostheses, many of the products and services that define the
      modern world have sprung from the minds and hands of MIT’s brilliant
      alumni community(opens in new window).
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>ADMISSION</h2>
    <p>
      Intensely curious and driven to explore, the people of MIT value rigorous
      analytical thinking, ingenuity, hands-on problem solving, and big new
      ideas(opens in new window). Stimulating, supportive, and playful, the MIT
      community(opens in new window) becomes, for many students, a second home.

      For professionals in the workforce and for learners anywhere eager for MIT
      content without the full-time commitment of a traditional degree program,
      we offer a range of educational options — some online(opens in new
      window), some on campus, and some a blend of both.
